# RWDevCon-AdaptiveLayout

This repo contains the project files associated with the tutorial on Adaptive
Layout for [RWDevCon](http://www.rwdevcon.com/) 2015.

The app is called __LocalWeather__, and is a really simple static weather app.
The app appears in 4 different directories:

    - 1-starter   => Non-adaptive app
    - 2-demo      => Add layout override for compact height. And a conditionally
                     installed map view
    - 3-lab       => Adds size-class dependent fonts and adaptive sizing
    - 4-challenge => Adds size-class dependent imagery via the asset library
