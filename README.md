# HandsOnAdaptiveLayout

This repo contains the project files associated with the __Hands on with
Adaptive Layout__ talk.

The app is called __LocalWeather__, and is a really simple static weather app.
The app follows the hands-on talk with different commits. The initial project
is tagged __StarterProject__. The __HEAD__ of the master branch represents the
completed project.

It has been tested with the released version of Xcode 6.2.
